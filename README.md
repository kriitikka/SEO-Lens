##  The Dual Strategy: SEO vs. AEO

In 2024 and beyond, ranking on a search page is only half the battle. You also need to be the "source of truth" for AI. AeroSearch bridges this gap:

### 1. Traditional SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
* **The Goal:** Rank your URL in the "ten blue links" on Google/Bing.
* **The Focus:** Keywords, backlinks, site speed, and meta tags.
* **AeroSearch's Role:** Analyzes SERP competitors to tell you exactly what keywords and structure you need to rank #1.

### 2. AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)
* **The Goal:** Be the direct citation or "answer" provided by AI models and Voice Assistants.
* **The Focus:** Authority, concise formatting, direct answers to questions, and factual accuracy.
* **AeroSearch's Role:** Evaluates your content's "cite-ability" and optimizes it for the specific formats that LLMs prefer, increasing your chances of being the featured answer.
